# AndroidProjects
These are the projects (small apps) developed for the course Mobile and Social Computing:

-LocationApp: an app to store a reminder in the mobile phone in a specific area which will be shown by a notification to the user when she/he is near that area. Here, I use a database to store the messages in a specific location.

-MetalDetector: an app that makes that your mobile phone becomes on a metal detector and emits a sound when it recognizes a metal. It is possible thanks to the barometer (a sensor of the mobile phone).

-Prototype: a simple interface with basic movements. A small practice of the different layouts.

-TwitterApp: an app which reads and displays the tweets of a specific account using the Twitter API.

-WeatherApp: an app that periodically reads and stores the weather information in a specific area in the background and shows the temperature, an image of the weather and the location. Besides, it sends a notification to the user with the temperature and the location.
